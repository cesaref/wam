## Web Audio Modules

This repository contains some example Cmajor patches which have been exported as Web Audio Modules for testing and development purposes.

The patches in question are examples from the public Cmajor repository:

https://github.com/cmajor-lang/cmajor/tree/main/examples/patches

These examples are being used to cover audio processing and instruments, and either custom or generic GUIs.
